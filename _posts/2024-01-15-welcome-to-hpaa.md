Welcome to the official website of the **Hot Pot Astronomical Association (HPAA)**! We're excited to share our passion for astronomy and hot pot culture with the world.

## Our Story

The name 'hot pot' originates from 2017 CalStar in Whisper Canyon, where we cooked Chinese hot pot under the stars. The universe was born in a hot dense soup, and we believe the sky with all kinds of galaxies/nebulae/stars is just like the hot pot with different food inside.

火锅天文协会(HPAA)，是旧金山湾区的一个华人天文爱好者组织。宇宙诞生于一团热汤之中，就好像我们的火锅。我们在加州黑暗的天空下，抬头看宇宙，低头吃火锅，享受天文，享受生活。

## What We Do

HPAA is a Chinese astronomy enthusiasts organization in the San Francisco Bay Area. We enjoy astronomy and life under the dark California sky, looking up at the universe while enjoying hot pot below.
